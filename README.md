### We were born to pursue knowledge
### For we were all born with nought
### Before we were given a language
### Out hands reach out, without being taught

### All are to see, All are to know
### We think. We uncover. We theorize.
### The pursuers then throw themselves to the dark again.

### But why, some say, the moon? 
### Why choose this as our goal? 
### And they may well ask,
### why climb the highest mountain? 
### Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? 
### Why does Rice play Texas? 

## We choose to go to the moon!
